## Detailed Project Description

In this academic project, my classmate and I embarked on designing and realizing a drone control system. The project began with the meticulous assembly of the drone components, ensuring a robust foundation. Calibration of the Ardupilot board was performed using Mission Planner software, which was essential for obtaining accurate sensor data. The initial flight tests were conducted to evaluate the setup in real-world conditions.

Building on this, we developed a custom control board capable of reading sensor parameters and controlling the motors. This new control board replaced the existing Ardupilot board and was connected to the receiver and motors to ensure seamless communication. The theoretical aspects of brushless motors were studied, and the system was modeled in ISIS and Simulink, helping us understand and predict system behavior.

A significant part of the project involved developing and implementing a PID controller. We coded the controller to achieve precise drone control and set up real-time parameter displays for metrics like pitch and roll, allowing us to monitor flight performance in real time. Extensive testing was carried out under safe conditions to ensure the system's reliability and safety, preventing injuries and avoiding system damage.

This project was a significant milestone in our engineering journey, providing practical experience and a deeper understanding of drone technology. Special thanks to our professors and peers for their invaluable support and guidance throughout this project.


## Summary

Our project successfully demonstrated the integration of theoretical knowledge and practical application, resulting in a well-functioning drone control system. The development of a stable PID algorithm, the integration of RC and SPI protocols, and the use of Matlab/Simulink for performance optimization were key achievements that contributed to the project's success.
